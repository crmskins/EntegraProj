To run this code, make sure to have both .java classes in the same package. I was running the code in Eclipse, so I was simply
using the default package. Also make sure to include the .txt file in the java project as well.

With that being said, that is about all that needs done if I can recall correctly, if not please do not
hesitate to email me.

Also, there are many comments throughout my code so you should have a good idea of what is being done, but if not, please
ask me also.

Thanks!
